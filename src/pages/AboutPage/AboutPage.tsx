                                I studied 2 terms of Java, one term of Python and one term of ML.
                                My experience from those lessons is the development of relay protection algorithms, but
                                there was one lesson per 2 or 3 weeks.

                                After two terms had passed I decided it'd be a waste not to use this knowledge of Java.
                                Although at first I didn't like programming because of it's complexity, but I decided to
                                go further,
                                so I started learning Java core, Spring, SQL, e.t.c alongside with the uni studying
                                during free time and on April of 2021 I got my first job as a develop. </span>

                        Using Ansible I have automated Jenkins setup, creation of pipelines and webhooks is accomplished by JCasc, creation of k3s cluster, transfer kubeconfig to Jenkins VM to restrict Jenkins within specific namespace and acquiring tls certificates from Let's encrypt with Traefik.

                        The project's main purpose is to practice with technologies such as:
